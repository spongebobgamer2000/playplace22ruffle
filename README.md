### Script to use Ruffle Flash Emulator with Embedded Scripts

# Well i've decided to archive this repository for the reason of: it takes a lot of work, if no one coorperates i can't do it and its not worth it to do it alone. This will still work with the 05/20/2021 Build but i won't update it anymore.

*CHECK OUT THE MAKERS OF RUFFLE OK SO I DONT GET SUED https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle*

**I advise you to check out the Wiki on how to put it on your Google Sites site and how to upload the .swf file: https://github.com/Happygamer1450/Ruffle-Embedded/wiki
